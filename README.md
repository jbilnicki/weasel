# weasel_java
evolution simulator - program based on Richard Dawkins' idea.This time implemented in java.
User type a desired string. Program generates random string (length of the user's string) and mutates the string many times (generation of 'offspring'). Then program chooses string that is resemples the users's string the most and sets it as a new 'parent'. Programs display best string from each generation and runs in a loop until it reaches string provided by the user.
